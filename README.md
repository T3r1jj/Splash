# Splash!
Splash! is a raster graphics editor written in Java (Swing). Besides default drawing features, it supports basic filters, layers management, transparency and state save. However, the main purpose of this project was to learn design patterns and put them into practice. The resulting project is a combination of more than 10 different design patterns. Detailed overview can be found on [the project page](https://t3r1jj.github.io/Splash "Splash! project page").
